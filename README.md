## About

Welcome, 

 To the Mad Libs Game, a Python project developed as the third project for the Code Institute course. This is a fun and interactive word game that lets players create humorous and often silly stories by inputting words such as nouns, verbs, colors, animals, and numbers. These words are then inserted into a story template, providing entertainment.

## UX: User experience:

 - As a user of the site, I want the content to be in English for better understanding.
 - As a user of the site, I desire a game that provides entertainment and serves as a distraction.
 - As a user of the site, I value clear and concise rules to gain a better understanding of the game's mechanics.
 - As a user of the site, I appreciate an easy-to-play game, and I expect to grasp it after the first round.
 - As a user of the site, I would like the option to replay the game once I've completed it.

## Initial concept:

 My initial idea for this project was to develop a user-friendly website that would serve as a platform for people seeking an easy and entertaining game, allowing them to enjoy a moment of laughter and creativity with the unpredictable and often hilarious results of Mad Libs.

### Target Audience:

 The target audience for this project is diverse and includes:

 - English language learners who can use Mad Libs as an engaging educational tool to better understand nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.
 - Friends and groups looking for an enjoyable and light-hearted activity to have a laugh.
 - Anyone in need of a quick and fun distraction from their daily routine.

### Key Objectives:
 - Provide an easy-to-understand and easy-to-play game: The primary goal is to make Mad Libs accessible to users of all ages and students with a minimum of a B1 knolodge of English. The game should be intuitive and enjoyable for both newcomers and experienced players.

 - Create a clean and user-friendly platform: The website's design should be clean and easy on the eyes. It should have an intuitive user interface, expcted the user would understand the game after the first round.

 - Attract and engage users seeking relaxation and entertainment: We aim to create a space where users can unwind, have a good time, and create an crazy and hilarious story.

## Wireframes

 The wireframes are intentionally kept very simple, with clear, direct, and concise information. Additionally, a 'sleep' function is used for a few seconds to give the user the chance to read the necessary information.

 The first wireframe represents the initial page, which includes a welcome message, rules, and a prompt for the user to choose a subject to play.

 The second wireframe illustrates what the user would see after selecting a subject and entering the keywords. In this case, the user would receive the result of their story and would be asked if they'd like to play again.

 If the user's response to the previous question is 'y,' they will return to the subject selection screen and repeat the steps mentioned above.

Should the user's answer to the above question be anything other than 'y,' the game will conclude with a friendly message inviting the user to visit my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/MariaPadilha32?tab=repositories).

  A short explanation for the FLow Chart above:
 
 1-  When the user runs the program, they will encounter a "welcome message" and the game rules. In Python, this part of the function is straightforward and direct.
 
 2- The second part of the Flow Chart involves the user selecting a subject to play. In Python, this is the primary function that drives the game.
 
 3- The third part includes the various subjects. In Python, each subject is stored in a separate file, with each having its own function separated from the main function.
 
 4- The fourth part prompts the user to enter multiple words. For each subject, the function is located in a different file(as mentioned above).
 
 5- In the fifth part, the Mad Lib will be generated and displayed to the user. Additionally, the user will be asked if they want to continue playing or end the game.
 
 6- The sixth part comes into play if the user decides to play again. The screen is cleared, and the user is presented with options to select a subject (returning to step 2 in the flow chart).
 
 7- The seventh part is activated if the user decides to end the game. In this case, the user will receive a farewell message, and the function will pause and stop.
